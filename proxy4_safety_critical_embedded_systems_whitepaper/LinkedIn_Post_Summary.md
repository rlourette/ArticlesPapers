ðŸš€ **New White Paper: Modern C++ Finally Ready for Safety-Critical Embedded Systems**

Traditional C++ polymorphism in embedded systems = choose your poison: heap allocation risks, virtual function overhead, or certification nightmares.

Microsoft Proxy 4 + Embedded Template Library changes everything:
âœ… 40-60% faster polymorphic calls
âœ… Zero dynamic allocation
âœ… 80% less certification overhead
âœ… Battle-tested in production systems

My new white paper shows exactly how to leverage this game-changing combination for aerospace, automotive, medical, and IoT applications.

6,000 words of technical depth, real code examples, and migration strategies for embedded engineers who refuse to compromise between safety and expressiveness.

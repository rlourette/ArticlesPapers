[Mojo Programming Language for Versal ACAP RT FPGA Platform: A Unified Approach to Space Computing and AI Acceleration](Mojo_Programming_Language_for_Versal_ACAP_RT_FPGA_Platform_A_Unified_Approach_to_Space_Computing_and_AI_Acceleration/Mojo_Programming_Language_for_Versal_ACAP_RT_FPGA_Platform_A_Unified_Approach_to_Space_Computing_and_AI_Acceleration.md) - Having spent considerable time tracking the evolution of the Mojo programming language and recently completing the architecture of a spacecraft payload processing system utilizing Versal FPGAs alongside other processing elements, I've become increasingly intrigued by the potential convergence of these technologies. This white paper presents a hypothetical exploration: what if Mojo's innovative compiler infrastructure could target the Versal ACAP platform?

[C++26 Reflection: Transforming Automotive Virtualization Through Compile-Time Code Generation](C++26_Reflection-A_Game_Changer_for_Automotive_Virtualization_and_Safety-Critical_C_Code_Generation/C++26_Reflection-A_Game_Changer_for_Automotive_Virtualization_and_Safety-Critical_C_Code_Generation.md) - A comprehensive technical article demonstrating how C++26's officially ratified reflection features can revolutionize automotive software development by enabling automatic generation of safety-certified C code from high-level system definitions. Shows how to eliminate interface mismatches, reduce testing costs, accelerate development cycles, and simplify certification processes for ECU interfaces, CAN messaging, and ISO 26262 ASIL-D compliant systems through compile-time code generation that produces MISRA-C:2012 compliant output.

[Modern C++ Finally Ready for Safety-Critical Embedded Systems: Microsoft Proxy 4 + Embedded Template Library](proxy4_safety_critical_embedded_systems_whitepaper/proxy4-safety-critical-embedded-systems-whitepaper.md) - A comprehensive 6,000-word technical white paper demonstrating how Microsoft Proxy 4 combined with the Embedded Template Library revolutionizes C++ polymorphism for safety-critical applications. Features 40-60% faster polymorphic calls, zero dynamic allocation, 80% less certification overhead, and battle-tested production implementations for aerospace, automotive, medical, and IoT systems with detailed migration strategies and real code examples.

[Hybrid BLE-Thread Warehouse Asset Tracking System](Hybrid_BLE-Thread_Warehouse_Asset_Tracking_System/Hybrid_BLE-Thread_Warehouse_Asset_Tracking_System.md) - A comprehensive technical specification for ultra-large-scale warehouse asset tracking using hybrid BLE-Thread mesh networking. Demonstrates how to achieve multi-year battery life while tracking 100,000+ assets across warehouse facilities, featuring Eddystone-EID encryption, asynchronous detection mechanics, power-optimized mesh networking, and discrete event simulation validation for 1,000 tags per pallet density.

[Using a NavCam for Autonomous Lunar Position Determination: Implementation on Microchip's HPSC Platform](In-Situ%20Lunar%20Navigation%20with%20NavCam/Using_HPSC_and_NavCam_for_Autonomous_Lunar_Position_Determination.md) - A comprehensive technical implementation guide demonstrating how Microchip's High-Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) platform enables real-time terrain-relative navigation for lunar spacecraft. Features detailed resource allocation across heterogeneous cores (ARM Cortex-A53/R52, Mali GPU), optimized algorithms for phase correlation and feature matching, and complete performance analysis achieving 2.5 Hz navigation updates with meter-level positioning accuracy.

[Using a NavCam for Autonomous Lunar Position Determination](In-Situ%20Lunar%20Navigation%20with%20NavCam/Using_a_NavCam_for_Autonomous_Lunar_Position_Determination.md) - A technical white paper detailing how lunar spacecraft can autonomously determine their position using navigation cameras and terrain-relative navigation techniques, including image registration, digital elevation models, and Extended Kalman Filtering.

[Eliminating Dynamic Memory in Embedded Protocols with C++26 Static Reflection: A CoAP Case Study](Eliminate_Dynamic_Memory_in_Embedded_Protocols_with_C++26_Static_Reflection/Eliminate_Dynamic_Memory_in_Embedded_Protocols_with_C++26_Static_Reflection.md) - A comprehensive technical article demonstrating how C++26's static reflection enables zero-allocation protocol implementation for embedded systems, using CoAP as a practical case study and featuring compile-time security policies, DTLS integration, and safety-critical compliance.

[Functional_Safety_Standards_Hierarchy_and_Modern_C++_Support_for_ProfiSafe_Implementation.md](Functional_Safety_Standards_Hierarchy_and_Modern_C++_Support_for_ProfiSafe_Implementation.md) - A technical white paper examining how C++26 features can enhance ProfiSafe implementation while maintaining compliance with IEC 61508 and other functional safety standards.

[C++26_Reflection-Revolutionizing_Memory-Constrained_Embedded_Systems.md](C++26_Reflection_-_Revolutionizing_Memory-Constrained_Embedded_Systems/C++26_Reflection-Revolutionizing_Memory-Constrained_Embedded_Systems.md) - C++26 Reflection article with lessons from the Kodak MC3 Digital Camera

[How My Morning Coffee Reveals the Magic of GPS RTK Technology](Coffee_GPS_RTK_Article/coffee_gps_rtk_article.md) - A personal exploration of GPS RTK technology through the lens of autonomous lawn mowing, explaining how centimeter-level precision is achieved.

[Using a NavCam for Autonomous Lunar Position Determination: Implementation on Microchip's HPSC Platform](In-Situ%20Lunar%20Navigation%20with%20NavCam/Using_HPSC_and_NavCam_for_Autonomous_Lunar_Position_Determination.md) - A comprehensive technical implementation guide demonstrating how Microchip's High-Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) platform enables real-time terrain-relative navigation for lunar spacecraft. Features detailed resource allocation across heterogeneous cores (ARM Cortex-A53/R52, Mali GPU), optimized algorithms for phase correlation and feature matching, and complete performance analysis achieving 2.5 Hz navigation updates with meter-level positioning accuracy.

[Using a NavCam for Autonomous Lunar Position Determination](In-Situ%20Lunar%20Navigation%20with%20NavCam/Using_a_NavCam_for_Autonomous_Lunar_Position_Determination.md) - A technical white paper detailing how lunar spacecraft can autonomously determine their position using navigation cameras and terrain-relative navigation techniques, including image registration, digital elevation models, and Extended Kalman Filtering.

[Eliminating Dynamic Memory in Embedded Protocols with C++26 Static Reflection: A CoAP Case Study](Eliminate_Dynamic_Memory_in_Embedded_Protocols_with_C++26_Static_Reflection/Eliminate_Dynamic_Memory_in_Embedded_Protocols_with_C++26_Static_Reflection.md) - A comprehensive technical article demonstrating how C++26's static reflection enables zero-allocation protocol implementation for embedded systems, using CoAP as a practical case study and featuring compile-time security policies, DTLS integration, and safety-critical compliance.

[Functional_Safety_Standards_Hierarchy_and_Modern_C++_Support_for_ProfiSafe_Implementation.md](Functional_Safety_Standards_Hierarchy_and_Modern_C++_Support_for_ProfiSafe_Implementation.md) - A technical white paper examining how C++26 features can enhance ProfiSafe implementation while maintaining compliance with IEC 61508 and other functional safety standards.

[C++26_Reflection-Revolutionizing_Memory-Constrained_Embedded_Systems.md](C++26_Reflection_-_Revolutionizing_Memory-Constrained_Embedded_Systems/C++26_Reflection-Revolutionizing_Memory-Constrained_Embedded_Systems.md) - C++26 Reflection article with lessons from the Kodak MC3 Digital Camera

[How My Morning Coffee Reveals the Magic of GPS RTK Technology](Coffee_GPS_RTK_Article/coffee_gps_rtk_article.md) - A personal exploration of GPS RTK technology through the lens of autonomous lawn mowing, explaining how centimeter-level precision is achieved.

Ever wonder how autonomous vehicles avoid "seeing double" when multiple sensors detect the same object? Or how SpaceX coordinates 33 Raptor engines without destructive oscillations? The answer is IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol. After implementing GPS-based PTP grandmaster functionality, I've seen how microsecond synchronization transforms sensor confusion into sensor fusion. This article explores why PTP is the unsung hero of autonomous systems and reveals what "clock disciplining" actually means, the secret sauce most discussions overlook.
